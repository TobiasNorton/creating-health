            <h3>The Real Cost of Employee Disengagement</h3>
            <p className="corp-wellness">
              Do you know the level of employee disengagement at your business? According to a
              recent Gallup poll, only 33% of workers in the United States are engaged in their
              jobs, which means the remaining 51% of employees are disengaged and 16% are actively
              disengaged.
            </p>
            <h4>What is employee engagement?</h4>
            <p>
              Gallup defines engaged employees as those who are involved in, enthusiastic about and
              committed to their work and workplace. Gallup categorizes workers as engaged, not
              engaged or actively disengaged based on their responses to key workplace elements.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Engaged: Employees are highly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and
                  workplace. They are psychological “owners,” drive performance and innovation, and
                  move the organization forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Not engaged: Employees are psychologically unattached to their work and company.
                  Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they’re putting time — but
                  not energy or passion — into their work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Actively disengaged: Employees aren’t just unhappy at work — they are resentful
                  that their needs aren’t being met and are acting out their unhappiness. Every day,
                  these workers potentially undermine what their engaged coworkers accomplish.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>What does that mean for you?</h4>
              <p>Disengaged employees are either:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>just co-existing in your workplace</li>
                <li>saying negative things about your company, or</li>
                <li>
                  lacking any involvement with their teams or initiatives to keep pushing the
                  company forward.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
              <p>
                Disengaged employees are costing you money and affecting your profits. The
                hard-nosed reality is that if you do nothing to help employee disengagement, you are
                wasting money each year. Each disengaged employee costs you 34% of their salary
                because of lost productivity, missed shifts, chronic tardiness, and disrupting
                others by spreading negativity throughout the company. Actively disengaged employees
                are miserable in the workplace and destroy the positive benefits engaged employees
                work so hard to build for the company. <br />
                <br />
                Businesses often think employee engagement is about satisfaction and happiness, but
                it goes much deeper. Employee engagement involves how much workers want to be
                engaged in the business, be proactive about their schedule, and be positive about
                where the company is going and how they treat their coworkers.
              </p>
              <h4>A Key to Better Engagement</h4>
              <p>
                Disengaged employees lose the motivation to give their best effort to help your
                business succeed. Actively disengaged employees cost the U.S. $483 billion to $605
                billion each year in lost productivity. A high price to pay for disengagement. By
                helping employees with Relationship Repair you’ll start seeing higher productivity,
                lower levels of sick leave use, less work time missed due to workplace injury or
                illness, lower levels of attrition, and higher levels of employee satisfaction.
                According to Gallup, improving employee engagement strongly impacts the overall
                well-being of your business. Employee engagement was found to have the following
                effects:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>17% higher productivity</li>
                <li>21% higher profitability</li>
                <li>10% higher customer satisfaction</li>
                <li>41% lower absenteeism</li>
                <li>24% less turnover (in high-turnover organizations)</li>
                <li>59% less turnover (in low-turnover organizations)</li>
                <li>70% fewer safety incidents </li>
                <li>40% fewer defects and quality issues</li>
              </ul>
              The truth comes down to this: if you ignore employee disengagement, employees will opt
              out at work. Providing Relationship Repair will not only help your employees with
              family conflict, it will impact workplace conflict amounting to higher engagement
              along with higher productivity within your business, which means happier employees and
              higher profits.
